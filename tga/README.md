# tga

tga is a [Go](http://golang.org/) package for decoding and encoding TARGA image
format.

It supports RLE and raw TARGA images with 8/15/16/24/32 bits per pixel,
monochrome, truecolor and colormapped images. It also correctly handles origins,
attribute type in extensions area and successfully passes TGA 2.0 conformance
suite (http://googlesites.inequation.org/tgautilities).

Encoding an image doesn't involve conversion if it's `image.Gray`, `image.RGBA`
or `image.NRGBA`. Other types are converted to `image.NRGBA` prior to encoding.
